# C++ learning challenge

Learn at least 3 programming languages simultaneously.
Spend 15 minutes per language daily.
This repo is for C++.

Initial challenge - go through a Udemy course on C++ for around 15 minutes daily.

13th - 15th Nov, 2018 - Set up IDE Clion. Start over again the Udemy course on C++ I did not finish previously. Start with hello world and variables.
15th Nov, 2018 - variable types. Arithmetic operators are the same as other languages.
21st Nov - if statement, the same as javascript.
Sat 24th Nov - switch, array, multidimentional array.
Mon 26th Nov - for loop
Sun 2nd Dec - while loop, nested loop, continue and break - they are basically the same as javascript. But, in c 0 means false. So, this can be used for while or conditions to check true/false.
Wed 5th Dec - variable scoping
